                My daughter wanted a pony, I got her something better
            </h2>
            <p class="article-teaser">
                Horses aren't cheap or easy to take care of, especially not for
                my 3-year-old daughter. Instead of explaining that to her, I did
                this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Giving a toddler her own pet sounds like an irresponsible
                decision, but I have good reason. I want to groom my daughter
                into continuing this blog in a few years, so I have a strong
                financial interest in her being a dog person first and foremost.
                The worst thing I could image is her favouring any other kind of
                animal. You can't imagine my disappointment when she told me
                last month that she wanted a pony. My own flesh and blood! Now,
                you can't fault a 3yo for having wrong opinions, but this
                reinforced my believe that she needs to have as much contact
                with dogs as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are still not convinced that a dog is better: How is it
                more appropriate to give her a pony instead? They are heavy, may
                kick her in the head and are easily spooked. Also my daughter is
                too small to ride one anyway, duh. A large dog on the other hand
                has the perfect shoulder height for riding. I bought a small
                saddle that fits her perfectly and now when we're going for a
                walk, she's riding Bruno, our Giant Dane. We don't even need a
                buggy anymore and judging from her noisy complaints, her inner
                thighs are getting a great workout as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most people we meet in the park seem to approve of her new
                'pony' and a couple even asked where I got the saddle. Maybe I
                should add a shop to this website where you folks can buy one?
                Just be aware that the police and or child protective services
                may get a bit confused when you let your daughter walk the dog
                by herself. Obviously she needs to learn how to care for the
                animal and take her responsibilities seriously. It is important
                to me that she carries on my legacy and so I've been doing
                creative writing lessons with her every week at her foster
                parents' place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, thanks for reading. If you're interested in buying a
                toddler-sized saddle, post a comment in this webzone! I might do
                a merch drop in a few months.
