## My daughter wanted a pony, I got her something better
Horses aren't cheap or easy to take care of, especially not for my 3-year-old
daughter. Instead of explaining that to her, I did this.

Giving a toddler her own pet sounds like an unresponsible decision, but I have
good reason. I want to groom my daughter into continuing this blog in a few
years, so I have a strong financial interest in her being a dog person first and
foremost. The worst thing I could image is her favouring any other kind of
animal. You can't imagine my disappointment when she told me last month that she
wanted a pony. My own flesh and blood! Now, you can't fault a 3yo for having
wrong opinions, but this reinforced my believe that she needs to have as much
contact with dogs as possible.

If you are still not convinced that a dog is better: How is it more appropriate
to give her a pony instead? They are heavy, may kick her in the head and are
easily spooked. Also my daughter is too small to ride one anyway, duh. A large
dog on the other hand has the perfect shoulder height for riding. I bought a
small saddle that fits her perfectly and now when we're going for a walk, she's
riding Bruno, our Giant Dane. We don't even need a buggy anymore and judging
from her loud complaints, her inner thighs are getting a great workout as well.

Most people we meet in the park seem to approve of her new 'pony' and a couple
even asked where I got the saddle. Maybe I should add a shop to this website
where you folks can buy one? Just be aware that the police and or child
protective services may get a bit confused when you let your daughter walk the
dog by herself. Obviously she needs to learn how to care for the animal and take
her responsibilities seriously. It is important to me that she carries on my
legacy and so I've been doing creative writing lessons with her every week at
her foster parents' place.

Anyway, thanks for reading. If you're interested in buying a toddler-sized
saddle, post a comment in this webzone! I might do a merch drop in a few months.
